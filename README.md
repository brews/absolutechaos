# absolutechaos

Rougelike RPG dungeon crawler with a text-based user interface and entity-component system architecture. Think [NetHack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetHack), but poorly written.

> [!NOTE]  
> This project is under development.

## How to run

Clone the repo and be sure you have a copy of `cargo` installed and configured. From the root of the repo run

```shell
cargo run --release
```

This will collect dependencies and compile the program into a single binary before launching the game.
